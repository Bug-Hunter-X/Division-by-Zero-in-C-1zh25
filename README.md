# Division by Zero Bug in C
This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains code that attempts to divide an integer by zero, leading to undefined behavior, typically a segmentation fault or program crash.
The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version of the code, including error handling to prevent division by zero.
